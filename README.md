# Final Project ETL
CIS 9440 - Data Warehousing for Analytics
Final Project Milestone 3
Group Number - <number>
Student(s) - <name>
For your Final Project, you/your project group will design and develop a Data Warehouse for
Analytics following the Kimball Lifecycle.
In Project Milestone #1, you/your project group completed a Project Proposal that included:
● A project idea, motivation, and description
● Business Justification for the project
● Technical Justification for the project
● Identified data source(s) to use for your project
● Created at least 5 KPI’s your Data Warehouse will measure
In Project Milestone #2, you/your project group designed a Dimensional Model that included:
● Completed Kimball Bus Matrix
● Dimensional Model that will produce your KPI’s
● Refined list of KPI’s
For Milestone #3, you/your project group will implement a Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
process on your dataset(s) found in Milestone #1 to physically load them onto Google
BigQuery in the Dimensional Modeled tables you designed in Milestone #2.
To accomplish this, you/your project group may use python, SQL, Excel, any programming
language, or any ETL/Dimensional Modeling tools necessary to Extract, Transform, and Load
your datasets into Fact Tables and Dimensions on Google BigQuery. Along the way, you must
document all ETL steps taken to show your process. To document steps, you may include
screenshots, write summary text, and/or include pieces of code. All members of each Project
Group must submit this Milestone on Blackboard. 
o submit this Milestone #3, please submit the following:
(1) Step-by-step summary of ETL process submitted as a PDF. This document will include
summary text and may include screenshots where necessary. There is no template for
this document, please organize the document to make it easily readable (2) (Optional) Files that contain code used in your ETL process. For example, you may
submit a .py file that you reference in your ETL Summary. This does not apply if you do
not use any code to implement ETL.
